How can you write big images to disk faster?

My test images are made by using [ImageMagick's](https://www.imagemagick.org/) convert tool, on [this excellently large railway schematic by the Indian government](https://ncr.indianrailways.gov.in/uploads/files/1420009273482-Agorikhas%2027-06.jpg)

It looks like a limitation in Java (number of calls to get byte(s) from BufferedImage?), rather than an I/O speed limitation.
